Hi this is one of my first C# programs and I had so much fun programming it :D

Tutorial:

Type a Number from 1 to 100 and try to find the actual number which is randomized everytime u start the program. U can also see if you are very far away from the number or very near with colors which make it really cool to guess the number. One of my first programs where Number Guesses in C# and i just decided to do this again a bit more complex :)
